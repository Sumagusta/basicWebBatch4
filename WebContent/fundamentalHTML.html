	<label>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
		distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
		layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
		normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
		content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
		publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
		default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
		web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
		the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
		humour and the like).</label>


	<!-- Paragraph -->
	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
		industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
		since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
		scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
		five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
		remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
		the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
		more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
		including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
